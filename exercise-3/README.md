# Exercise-3

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

# mkdir
## make directory

The `mkdir` command is used to make a new directory in the current working directory. For example:

```
mkdir NewDirectory
```

Here's some more information about the `mkdir` command:

1. `mkdir -p` will create parent directories if needed
* For example: `mkdir -p /Desktop/Parent/Child` will create a "Parent" folder and a "Child" subfolder.
2. `mkdir -m` will set permission mode
